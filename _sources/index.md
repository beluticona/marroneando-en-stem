# My dear Caja de Pandora

It’s been a while since I realized one day I’d publish a book. Not sure if one day I will publish something for real but, for instance, let’s start collecting all my personal writings.

## About this book

Over my years in school, I discovered that writing allows me to deeply understand my feelings and thoughts, even on those long gray days when everything looks a little bit fuzzy. Writing is the way I found to get to know myself better.

Reading my own words years after made me rediscovered myself even more. Remember what type of person I used to be and which were my motivations in life. Looking back in life feels weird, like having a coffee with a younger version of yourself. Sometimes I meet a young teenager full of dreams, innocent and too desperate to grown and achieve her expectations. It makes me feel even a little bit afraid of disappointing her, sometimes I’m not sure if I’m ready to meet her back. Other times I’m delighted to see how enthusiastic she is, recharging my energies to concrete my current goals. And other times it makes me very happy to let her know what beautiful things have happened, can almost feel her relief and how proud she is about the women I’ve become.

This book is dedicated to my future self. So you can continue growing and achieving whatever you propose. So you can remember who you used to be and decide better where you wanna go ahead.

This book is also for anyone who enjoy having deep conversations.

## About myself

If everything get deleted, all information about yourself get lost in the Internet so no one can ever find you, who would you say you were?

In my case, I’d say I was an Argentinian-Bolivian women, brown and nerd, enthusiastic and dramatic, someone who tried to live happily by helping others. That would be everything you need to know :)

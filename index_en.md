# My dear Caja de Pandora

It’s been a while since I realized one day I’d publish a book. Not sure if one day I will publish something for real but, for the moment, let’s start collecting all my personal writings.

## About this book

Over my years in school, I realized writing helps me understand my feelings and thoughts, even on those long gray days when everything looks a bit fuzzy and desolated. Writing is the way I get to know myself better.

Reading my own words years after helps me rediscover myself even more. What type of person I used to be? Which were my motivations in life? Looking back in life feels weird, like having a coffee with a younger self. Sometimes I meet a young teenager, full of dreams, innocent and too desperate to grown and achieve her goals. It even frighten me the idea of disappointing her (I guess this tells you a lot about me, huh?). Sometimes I’m not sure if I’m ready to meet her back...other times I’m delighted to see how enthusiastic she is, recharging my energies to concrete my current goals. There're also moments when I can't help letting her know about the amazing moments that're to come, and ask her not to look forward the future that much but to embrace her present.

This book is dedicated to my future self. So you can continue growing and achieving whatever you propose. So you can remember who you used to be and decide better where you wanna go.

This book is also for anyone who enjoy having deep conversations. These writings does not reflect who I’m most of the time, but I does show what I think on those moments of personal inflection.

## About myself

Let's say its the end of the world, if everything gets deleted, all your information, all your social media...everything, except for a short description, who would you say you were? In my case, I’d say I was an Argentinian-Bolivian woman, Quechua-Aymara descendant, brown and nerd, enthusiastic, passionate and a little bit dramatic (just a little, for sure). Someone who aimed to live happily. That would be everything you need to know :)
